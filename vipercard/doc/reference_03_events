on___openCard
=====
Message sent upon going to a card.

Because messages continue up the hierarchy until they are handled, you can also respond to openCard in a stack script.

Examples:

-- in a card's script
on openCard
    answer "welcome to this card"
end openCard

=====
on___openBackground
=====
When you go to a different card, if the card belongs to a different background, the openBackground message will be sent. (You're leaving one background and going to another).

Examples:

-- in a background's script
on openBackground
    answer "welcome to this background"
end openBackground

=====
on___closeBackground
=====
When you go to a different card, if the card belongs to a different background, the closeBackground message will be sent. (You're leaving one background and going to another).

Examples:

-- in a background's script
on closeBackground
    answer "you have left this background"
end closeBackground

=====
on___openStack
=====
Message sent upon first opening the stack.

Examples:

-- in a stack's script
on openStack
    answer "welcome to this card"
end openStack

=====
on___closeCard
=====
Message sent upon leaving a card.

Because messages continue up the hierarchy until they are handled, you can also respond to closeCard in a stack script.

Examples:

-- in a card's script
on closeCard
    answer "you have left this card"
end closeCard

=====
on___idle
=====
Sent repeatedly to the current card. Can be used for a game loop.

(Note that to terminate a script that is being called repeatedly, 
you can change to the button or field tool.)

To get faster idle calls, at the expense of heavier cpu usage,
use
`set the idlerate to "faster"`

=====
on___mouseDoubleClick
=====
Remember that scripts are only run when you're in the Browse
tool (hand-shape). Create a button and type the example below.
Now when you choose the browse tool and double-click the
button, your code will run.

Examples:

on mouseDoubleClick
    answer "you double-clicked this button."
end mouseDoubleClick

=====
on___mouseDown
=====
Remember that scripts are only run when you're in the
Browse tool (hand-shape). Called whenever the mouse is 
pressed down onto the object. Create a button and type the 
example below. Now when you choose the browse tool and 
click the button, your code will run.

Examples:

on mouseDown
    answer "code is running."
end mouseDown

=====
on___mouseUp
=====
Remember that scripts are only run when you're in the Browse tool
(hand-shape). Called whenever the mouse is clicked. To be precise,
when the mouse is pressed down onto the object, and released on
the same object. Create a button and type the example below. 
Now when you choose the browse tool and click the button, 
your code will run.

Examples:

on mouseUp
    answer "code is running."
end mouseUp

=====
on___mouseEnter
=====
Remember that scripts are only run when you're in the Browse tool
(hand-shape). Called whenever the mouse enters the object.

on___mouseLeave
=====
Remember that scripts are only run when you're in the Browse tool
(hand-shape). Called whenever the mouse leaves the object.

=====
on___mouseWithin
=====
Called repeatedly when the cursor is inside the object.
You can use the mouseloc() function to get the position of the 
cursor. This can be used to create drag/drop effects.

(Note that to terminate a script that is being called repeatedly, 
you can change to the button or field tool.)

=====
on___afterKeyDown
=====

Called when a key is pressed.
You can use the functions `keyChar()`,  `shiftKey()`,  `optionKey()`, 
and `commandKey()`, to determine which key(s) where pressed.

`keyRepeated()` can be used to see if the key event comes from
the key having been held down.

Examples:

on afterKeyDown
    if keyChar() is "i" and not shiftKey() and \
            optionKey() and not commandKey() then
        answer "you pressed option-i"
    else if keyChar() is "U" and shiftKey() and \
            not optionKey() and not commandKey() then
        answer "you pressed shift-u"
    end if
end afterKeyDown
=====
on___afterKeyUp
=====

Called when a key is pressed and released.
You can use the functions keyChar(), shiftKey(), optionKey(), and
commandKey(), to determine which key(s) where pressed.

Examples:

on afterKeyUp
    if keyChar() is "i" and not shiftKey() and \
            optionKey() and not commandKey() then
        answer "you pressed option-i"
    else if keyChar() is "U" and shiftKey() and \
            not optionKey() and not commandKey() then
        answer "you pressed shift-u"
    end if
end afterKeyUp


=====
on___openField
=====
Sent to a field, when text is first selected in it.

See also: `closeField`.

Examples:

-- in a field's script

on openField
    -- place default text in the field when you tab over to it...
    put "abc" into the target
end openField

=====
on___closeField

Sent to a field when the selection leaves it. 

If the browse tool is active, this message will be sent by the following:
When you're typing text into a field, and click outside the field
When you're typing text into a field, and press Enter
When you're typing text into a field, and go to a different card

It's possible for closeField to be sent to the field more than once if some of the above actions happen at the same time.

See also: `openField`.

Examples:

-- in a field's script

on closeField
    -- do a simple check of what the user just typed
    if not "@" in the target or not "." in the target then
        put "Not a valid e-mail address" into cd fld "status"
    else
        put "" into cd fld "status"
