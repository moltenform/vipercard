target
=====
Refers to the object that was most recently acted on.
Here's one reason why this can be useful:
If you have many buttons that all basically perform the same

instead of a separate script within each button. This script in the
card could check the target to see which, if any, of the buttons
were clicked.

Similar to, but distinct from 'me'.

Examples:

put the id of target into theTarget

set the width of the target to 100

Similar to, but distinct from 'target'.

Examples:

put the id of me into theTarget
