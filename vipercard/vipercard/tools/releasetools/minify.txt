details:
    it looks like babel can also do this: 
    "build": "babel ./index.js --out-dir ./dist/index.js --no-comments"
    
    
    goal: minimize by taking whitespace, leaving newlines, stripping comments, and not mangling
    in webpack settings, the section
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
            hash: true,
            inject: true,
            template: '0.3/index.dev.html',
            minify: {
                removeComments: true,
                collapseWhitespace: true,
                removeRedundantAttributes: true,
                useShortDoctype: true,
                removeEmptyAttributes: true,
                removeStyleLinkTypeAttributes: true,
                keepClosingSlash: true,
                minifyJS: true,
                minifyCSS: true,
                minifyURLs: true,
            },
        }),
    the minify settings there seem to do nothing.
    
    add a new root level to really control it,
    (it's now based on Terser. add 
    const TerserPlugin = require('terser-webpack-plugin');
    I want a non-minified one that still has no comments
    this is as close as I got, but it still
    really puts everything onto one line
    optimization: {
        minimize: true,
        minimizer: [
        new TerserPlugin({
            terserOptions: {
                mangle: false,
            output: {
                comments: false,
            },
            },
        }),
        ],
    },
    
    so back to this to have no minification, and use a separate script to strip comments?
    optimization: {
        // Set this to false if you'd rather not minimize code,
        // if you get a warning about asset size you can add hints: false here too.
        minimize: false
    },   
    let text = fs.readFileSync(src, {encoding: "utf8"})
    const strip = require('strip-comments');
    const textOut = strip(text);
    fs.writeFileSync(src+'.out.js', textOut, {encoding: "utf8"})
    but this left many comments in the file :(
    
    online it looks like uglify can remove comments
    could add it to the list
   plugins: [ ,
        new UglifyJsPlugin(),
   ]
    note that the UglifyJsPlugin options are different than plain uglify options
    

    current working solution: removes 
    comments without minifying:
    npm install --save-dev uglifyjs-webpack-plugin
    const UglifyJsPlugin = require('uglifyjs-webpack-plugin')
    optimization: {
        minimize: true,
        minimizer: [
            new UglifyJsPlugin({
                uglifyOptions: {
                    output: {
                        comments: false,
                        beautify: true,
                    },
                    mangle: false,
                    compress: false,
                },
            }),
        ],
    },
    
Note: using conventions like referring to myFunction.name might be dangerous,
see what uglify does here:
    function X(){var e=null!==Y&&Y.apply(this,arguments)||this;
return e.isVpcNotificationMsg=!0,e.origClass=X.name,e}
X.name probably returns "X" which isn't intended.
